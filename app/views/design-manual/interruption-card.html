                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use it</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">Use this component in Remand and Sentencing to help prevent mistakes when a user’s action could affect other parts of the service, such as breaking a consecutive sentence chain.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Only use an interruption card when the user has a choice. They should always have the option to cancel the action and go back a step.</p>

                <p class="govuk-body">
                    The interruption card is part of the Ministry of Justice Design System.

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Use sparingly</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">Interruption cards should only be used when there’s no better way to prevent errors. Service design should minimise the chance of user actions leading to problems elsewhere.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Make sure there is a clear use case and avoid using them too often, as users may start to ignore them (known as banner blindness).</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When not to use it</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">Do not use an interruption card to block users from performing an action. It should highlight risks, not prevent action.</p>

                <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How it works</h2>
                <p class="govuk-body">The title of the interruption card should briefly describe the potential issue. If the journey is in the context of something specific (like a sentence), include this information—similar to the <a href="">contextual question pattern</a>.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">Give clear instructions that explain the potential impact elsewhere in the service and what the user may need to do as a result.</p>
                <p class="govuk-body">The card should ask whether the user wants to continue with the action. Provide a clear primary call to action and always offer a way to go back or cancel.</p>
