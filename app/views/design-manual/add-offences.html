          Let users add one or more offences in a structured, repeatable flow.

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">DWP Design System</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          This pattern is similar to the <a href="https://design-system.dwp.gov.uk/patterns/add-another-thing" class="govuk-link">Add another thing</a> pattern in the DWP Design System.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When to use it</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          Use this pattern when users need to add one or more offences to a court appearance.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
          It helps ensure offence details are entered in a consistent format and can be reviewed before continuing.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How it works</h2>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>The user is taken through a structured journey to the first offence</li>
          <li>They are then taken to the <a href="">offence summary page</a> </li>
          <li>On the summary page, users can:
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>add another offence</li>
              <li>edit an existing offence</li>
              <li>delete an offence</li>
              <li>continue to the next task</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
